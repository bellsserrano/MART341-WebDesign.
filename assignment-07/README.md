Please describe any forms you've come across while browsing the web. What purposes do they serve?
    I have come across text entry and password input. They are there for an individual to put in their username, phone number and or email along with their password which is hidden to get into their account for the specific business. I have used drop down menus on certain websites for options they may have. I have also seen buttons or selections before to submit and navigate through pages.
