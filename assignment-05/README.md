Tell me about a website you visited using The Wayback Machine. What year was it from? How is the older version different from the new version in terms of its overall design?
    I visited Apple's website. I went back to the year i was born, 2000 and compared it to their new version in 2022. In 2000 their site consisted of a lot of a lot of wording on the first page, definitely didn't use the equilateral texture method. They had one animation of texture in a typing format and had cutouts and pictures of products provided. It was an accessible and easy website to use. For the 2022 website, much ore up to date. Had a continuous flow to the page, more high def graphics, more color show casing their amenities and products. Overall, a much more appeal website which was predicted.
